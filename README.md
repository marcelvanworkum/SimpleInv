# SimplyInv
 
 SimpleInv is an inventory management platform built using Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap 4.
 
 This project was created for a local boutique store owner who needed to keep track of their shop's inventory but did
 not want to go with a full blown system such as Shopify or other stock management tools.
 
 It's basic, opinionated and get's a very specific job done.
 
 The code has been open soured using an Unlicense with the permission of the original client.
 
 The webapp is hosted for free using Heroku. A `Procfile` is included if you wish to do the same.
